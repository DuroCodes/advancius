# Hide and Seek

In Hide and Seek, the hiders are assigned to a block to hide as and, after standing still for a few seconds, will become like a solid block. Make sure to hide well though, as you have a team of seekers hunting you down! As the seeker, you must find and defeat all of the hiding players. Once a hider dies, they will join your team and become a seeker.
