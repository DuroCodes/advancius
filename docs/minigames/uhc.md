#UHC (Ultra Hard Core)

In the UHC gamemode, you will have only a short time to play survival and get as good gear and supplies as possible. After some time, PvP will turn on and you will then be tasked with hunting down your friends. After another period of time has elapsed, you will all be put together to fight one another at close combat. Compete to become the champion of your friends and the sole survivor!
