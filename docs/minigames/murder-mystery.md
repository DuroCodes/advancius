#Murder Mystery

In Murder Mystery, at least one player will be designated the murderer and will receive a sword after a certain amount of time. They will then have to hunt down all of the innocent players while trying to root out, and kill, the detective. The detective's job is to use clues to figure out who is the murderer and stop them before they can do harm to the innocent players. Try and catch your friends red handed as the detective, or try to stop and defeat all of your friends as the murderer!
