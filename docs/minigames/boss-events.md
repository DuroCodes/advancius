# Boss Events

Boss events is an event that happens every 2 hours. Players will have a bit of time to choose a kit, and then will battle hoards of monsters, going up to 10 rounds. Killing enemys will award nuggets and XP, which is used to upgrade your kits. When the final enemy in round 10 is complete, all players will be sent to the lobby and be given rewards.
