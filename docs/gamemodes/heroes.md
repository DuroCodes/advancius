# Heroes

In Heroes, there are many dungeons to conquer. You can also take a more relaxing approach with fishing and gain lots of money! You can also create clans to play with your friends, and rule the world!

### Tips and Tricks

#### Regeneration

- Regeneration helps way more than resistance in most cases. A good way to get more regeneration is to get the pokeball pet from **/pets** and upgrading it to max level.

#### Money making

- One of the easiest ways to get money is from fishing! You can get a free rod at **/fish** from Finnius the NPC.
