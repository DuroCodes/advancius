# Factions

In Factions, players build bases to guard their loot as they compete against each other to reach /f top #1. Building grinders, farms and anything else will give you the money and power needed in order to rule the land and leaderboards. 

For those that dare, you can even raid and steal other player's stuff in their bases to earn a fearsome reputation!
